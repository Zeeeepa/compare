# GitHub Compare Tool Enhancements

This PR enhances the merge functionality and multithreading capabilities of the GitHub Compare tool.

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced Multithreading

- **Thread Pool Manager**: Implemented a robust thread pool manager that efficiently handles multiple concurrent tasks
- **Task Tracking**: Added task tracking with unique IDs for better management and cancellation support
- **UI Responsiveness**: Improved UI responsiveness during long-running operations
- **Resource Management**: Added proper cleanup of thread resources when the application exits

### Enhanced Merge Functionality

- **Parallel Processing**: Implemented batch processing for better performance when handling large numbers of commits
- **Improved Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Conflict Resolution**: Added automatic conflict resolution capabilities
- **Multiple Merge Methods**: Support for different merge strategies (merge, squash, rebase)

## Files Added

- `merge_enhancements.py`: Contains the core enhanced functionality
- `integration_example.py`: Demonstrates how to integrate the enhancements
- `main_integration.py`: Script to automatically integrate the enhancements into the main application

## How to Use

1. Run the integration script:
   ```
   python main_integration.py
   ```

2. Launch the application as usual:
   ```
   python gitcompare.py
   ```

## Implementation Details

### ThreadPoolManager

The `ThreadPoolManager` class provides a robust way to manage multiple concurrent tasks:

- Uses Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` for efficient thread management
- Provides task tracking with unique IDs
- Supports task cancellation
- Includes a queue-based result collection mechanism
- Properly cleans up resources when shutting down

### EnhancedMergeFunctionality

The `EnhancedMergeFunctionality` class provides improved merge operations:

- Batch processing for better performance
- Multiple fallback methods for commit removal
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Automatic conflict resolution capabilities
- Support for different merge strategies

## Performance Improvements

- **Batch Processing**: Operations on multiple commits are now processed in batches for better performance
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple tasks can now run concurrently without blocking the UI
- **Reduced API Rate Limiting**: Added delays between API calls to avoid GitHub rate limiting
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Thread pool ensures efficient use of system resources
